<h2>Attract-Mode Frontend</h2>

<p>Attract-Mode is a graphical frontend for command line emulators such as 
MAME, MESS, and Nestopia.  It hides the underlying operating system and is 
intended to be controlled with a joystick, gamepad or spin dial, making it 
ideal for use in arcade cabinet setups.</p>

<p>Attract-Mode was originally developed for use in Linux.  It is known to work 
on Ubuntu Linux (x86, x86-64), Mac OS X (10.6.8), and Windows (XP and 7).</p>

<p>Attract-Mode is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, 
version 3 or later.</p>

<p>Please visit <a href="http://attractmode.org">http://attractmode.org</a> for more information.</p>

<p>See <a href="Compile.md">Compile.md</a> if you intend to compile Attract-Mode from source.</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Run Attract-Mode.  By default, Attract-Mode will look for its configuration
files in "$HOME/.attract" on Linux and Mac OS X, and in the current working 
directory on Windows-based systems.  If you want to use a different location
for the Attract-Mode configuration then you need to specify it at the command
line as follows:</p>

<pre><code>attract --config /my/config/location
</code></pre>

<p>In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Attract-Mode has difficulty finding
a display font to use on your system, you can specify one at the command line
as follows:</p>

<pre><code>attract --font &lt;font_name&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you are running Attract-Mode for the first time, it will load directly 
to its configuration mode.  If you do not start in config mode, pressing "TAB" 
will get you there.  By default, config mode can be navigated using the up/
down arrows, enter to select an option, and escape to go back.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the "Emulators" menu and edit/create a configuration for an 
emulator that you wish to use.  Default configurations are provided for some 
popular emulators, however some settings will likely have to be customized 
for your system (file locations etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have an emulator configured correctly for your system, select 
the "Generate Romlist" option from the emulator's configuration menu. <br />
Attract-Mode will use the configured emulator settings to generate a list of 
available games for the emulator.</p></li>
<li><p>Exit config mode by selecting the "Back" option a few times.  You should
now have a usable front-end!</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Further Customization</h2>

<p><strong>INPUT:</strong> The inputs used to control Attract-Mode can be configured from
from the "Input" menu in config mode.  Attract-Mode actions can be mapped to 
most keyboard, mouse and joystick inputs.</p>

<p><strong>LIST FILTERS:</strong> List filters can be added from the "Lists" menu in config
mode.  Each filter can have multiple rules associated with it (i.e. a "1980's
Multiplayer Sports" filter would have 3 rules: (1) that the year be in the 
1980's, (2) that the number of players is not 1, and (3) that the category
contain "Sports").  You can create multiple filters per List and cycle/switch
between them using the "Previous Filter", "Next Filter" and "Filters List"
actions.</p>

<p><strong>SOUND:</strong> To play sounds in your setup, place the sound file in the "sounds" 
subdirectory of your Attract-Mode config directory.  The sound file can then
be selected from the "Sound" menu when in config mode and mapped to an action
or event.</p>

<p><strong>ARTWORK:</strong> Attract-Mode supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP and TGA image formats.
When deciding what image file to use for a particular artwork type, Attract-
Mode will use the artwork/movie selection order set out below.  The default
artworks in Attract-Mode are: "marquee" (for cabinet marquee images),
"snap" (for game screen shots), "flyer" (for game flyer/box art) and "wheel"
(for HyperSpin wheel art).  You can add others as needed in the emulator
configuration menu.</p>

<p><strong>MOVIE:</strong> Attract-Mode should support any movie format supported by FFmpeg.
The movie to play is decided in the order set out below.</p>

<p><strong>ARTWORK/MOVIE SELECTION ORDER:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>From the artwork path configured in the emulator setting (if any):</p>

<ul><li>[Name].xxx  (i.e. "pacman.png")  </li>
<li>[CloneOf].xxx  (i.e. "puckman.gif")  </li>
<li>[Emulator].xxx (i.e. "mame.jpg")  </li></ul></li>
<li><p>From the layout path for the current layout (layouts are located in
the "layouts" subdirectory of your Attract-Mode config directory):</p>

<ul><li>[Emulator]-[ArtLabel].xxx  (i.e. "mame-marquee.png")  </li>
<li>[ArtLabel].xxx  (i.e. "marquee.png")  </li></ul></li>
<li><p>If no files are found matching the above rules, then the artwork/movie 
is left blank.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LAYOUTS:</strong> See: <a href="Layouts.md">Layouts.md</a></p>

<p><strong>PLUG-INS:</strong> Plug-ins are scripts that need to be placed in the "plugins"
subdirectory of your Attract-Mode config directory.  Their primary use is to
allow for integration between Attract-Mode and other software that can
benefit from knowing when events occur in the frontend.  Available plugins 
can be enabled/disabled and configured from the "Plug-Ins" menu when in 
config mode.</p>

<p><strong>ROMLISTS:</strong> Romlists are saved in the "romlist" subdirectory of your 
Attract-Mode config directory.  Each list is a semi-colon delimited text 
file that can be edited by most common spreadsheet programs (be sure to
load it as "Text CSV").  The file has one game entry per line, with the very 
first line of the file specifying what each column represents.</p>

<p>In addition to the romlist generation function available in config mode,
Attract-Mode can generate a romlist for multiple emulators from the command
line using the following command: </p>

<pre><code>    attract --build-romlist &lt;emulator names...&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also import romlists from MameWah/Wahcade! (.lst), Attract-Mode
(.txt) and HyperSpin (.xml) using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>    attract --import-romlist &lt;file&gt; [emulator name]
</code></pre>

<p>The --build-romlist and --import-romlist options can be chained together in
all sorts of strange and wonderful ways to generate combined Attract-Mode
romlists. So:</p>

<p><code>attract --import-romlist mame.lst --import-romlist nintendo.lst nestopia</code></p>

<p>will combine the entries from the mame.lst and nintendo.lst files (located
in the current directory) into a single Attract-Mode romlist.  The "mame"
emulator will be used for the mame.lst games, while the "nestopia" emulator
will be used for the nintendo.lst games.</p>

<p>If you wish to specify the name of the created romlist at the command
line, you can do so with the <code>--output &lt;name&gt;</code> option.  Beware that this will
overwrite any existing Attract-Mode romlist with the specified name.</p>
